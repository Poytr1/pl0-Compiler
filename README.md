# pl0-Compiler

This is my professional course "Compilers Principles" final project, so feel free if you want to copy it.

We just add some features on naive PL/0 compiler and make it a stronger language like C.

These features are including:
- short-cut calculation for bool expression 
- add array data-type
- for-loop and while-loop along with break statement
- call function with parameters: by value/reference and return statement 
- add some assert statements for stronger error-checking
- add several phantom directors to support such features
